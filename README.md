Resume Relevance Check

Automated Resume Relevance Check System ‚Äî a Streamlit-based web app that helps recruiters and placement teams evaluate candidate resumes against job descriptions.
It combines rule-based parsing, semantic similarity (embeddings), and AI feedback generation to provide structured evaluations.


Features

Upload job descriptions (TXT/PDF/DOCX) and candidate resumes (PDF/DOCX).

Extract and parse text content from resumes using pdfplumber / python-docx.

Compare resumes with job descriptions using:

Keyword & fuzzy matching

Semantic similarity (embeddings + cosine similarity)

Generate evaluation scores (0‚Äì100) with verdicts (High, Medium, Low).

Store results in SQLite database for reproducibility.

View analytics dashboard with charts, filters, and shortlisting options.

Modular backend (backend/) and frontend (frontend/) design for extensibility.
